So ya wanna make money for your hard work, eh? Who doesn&#8217;t? I sure as hell do which is why I will have a donation button.  Heck, I may have several just to get the point across that I want your money.

But am I going to offer game extra&#8217;s or charge to no? Notta chance. You many want to charge people to play or maybe just charge them to get the full experience,  but (I won&#8217;t say never will) intend on it. I may charge to have perks like no ads, friends list, crap like that but I am going to avoid game advantages like the plague.

And here is why: I make games not to make money. Money is nice and all but I view what I do more as an art than a job. Continue with the notation that what I do (design and code) is art, I want to have people enjoy my work equally. I would rather be popular and make no cash than have 1000 people play my game and make 500$ a month. But here&#8217;s another thing. Popular = more players = more donations.

So if I offer a truly enjoyable game, not one where people play to pass time,  but one where you WANT to play, one where you are excited to log on to, then I will be happy. Plus to boot if I have a game like that (some) people will want to donate.

Now, if I choose to ignore those reasons, and played with the idea of charging for bonuses this is what I come up with; You will have  a situation where the donors will always be stronger than the non-donors, which means a lot of the non-donors won&#8217;t want to play after a while. This I believe would hurt the community too much to be worth it. I think players left would either play just to do something or will be super competitive ruining the game for non-donor new comers.

Then we have pay to play. Sorry, I won&#8217;t pay to play standard MMORPG&#8217;s (Eve, WoW) why in the name of god would I pay to play a browser based game? &#8220;My game is that good&#8221; or &#8220;Pay to play makes the players think it must be good&#8221;. Whatever. I have yet to play a web game that has blown me away. I have paid for a few, I have donated to a few. The have been fun for&#8230; a week, maybe two. Come on. You think your game is the game to end all other games. It&#8217;s not. Sorry.

It may be damn good, but too many developers SUCK about game design. They can code but know shit about gameplay, or even their community.

So, if you are DEAD set on making money with your game, please do the perks, and not pay to play, because no one will play. I personally believe donations (without game perks) are the best not to make money, but to have a strong, happy community, which very likely in the end may pay more than a pissed of donation-game perk based community
