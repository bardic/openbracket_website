Hey all,

Sorry I haven&#8217;t posted anything new in a while&#8230; Like a month I think. I&#8217;ve been mad busy with work and I can actually show ya&#8217;s: <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/project-earth/game/game.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/project-earth/game/game.html</a>

Please note I had no hand in the play game design. I&#8217;m just a coder on this one. But this has given me quite a bit of experience working with a multiplayer server and as3 coding, which (hopefully) will translate into me eventually creating a flash mmo of some sort.

Taking a quick look at all the pbbg&#8217;s I&#8217;ve tried in the last month: no new development. I&#8217;ve seen people boosting unique game play, and I have been let down. All I&#8217;m finding are clones and a bunch of games where you click fight, you fight, then you level and actually buy new weapons/armor/etc then do it all again.

Sorry for anyone with a game like that, but that&#8217;s not new or inventive.

On the bright side, I have found a blog that I&#8217;d liek to share. This guy posts far more often than me and has some interesting stuff.

  And I leave ya with a question. Do you think that PBBGs are stagnating? There&#8217;s a few really good ones but the majority are clones and poorly done clones at that. We aren&#8217;t seeing a huge number of new features being thought of/used. And I&#8217;ve seen little to no advancement in gameplay. I may wrong and if I am, someone please show me a game that can prove me wrong ( I know of a few in alpha/betas that aren&#8217;t open yet that look really cool.. I&#8217;m look at you Cameon).
