Look at this awesome map! Look at it!

This is a rough map I made in a few minutes for my friend William aka jetfx (<http://jetfx.livejournal.com/>). William is a cartographer, a world builder freak and an aspiring author. He will hopefully be helping me with my maps and story for Lantern as we move forward. Whenever he has a better map that the pretty epic one I drew, I&#8217;ll post it for you all to see.

**\*UPDATE\***

William, being pretty damn quick, thought my map looked too crappy to share so he cleaned it up for me as you can see. I decided to leave mine so you can see how much better he is and why I&#8217;m pretty stoked he&#8217;s agreed to help.
