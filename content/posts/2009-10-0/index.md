This is a quick post about a game that I have recently started playing, and frankly, I am enjoying it greatly so far. The game is called, in case you haven&#8217;t guess, [Cthulhu Nation][1].

It&#8217;s is a rather complex RPG from what I can tell, with a great story and setting (HP Lovecraft being one of my favorite authors) and great art. The quests are clever and seem to lean towards the puzzle-ly side of things (which is perfect for lovecraft).

I can&#8217;t say much more about it since I&#8217;m still rather new to the game, but I suggest you all check it out.

Oh, I forgot to mention it won the Galaxy News best story of the year award in 07 ^_^
