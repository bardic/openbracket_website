Before I start on a new design, which is often&#8230; I have too many idea&#8217;s and not enough time with life being as busy as it is&#8230; But anyways, whenever I start a new design I think to myself: Why will people want to play this game and not that game? What will make mine stand out and attract people? How can I do everything better and then do it better than that? How much effort do I want the player to need to put into the game?

Can you answer all of these questions when you think of your game or designs?
