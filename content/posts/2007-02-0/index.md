Thats what PBBG is, and many of us developers/players work on/play.

Bud (the guy that owns the PBBG I linked to) was trying to define the genre because it&#8217;s not quite a MMOG because it&#8217;s played in a browser. And this is what he came up with.

If you are unsure of what style of game this describes, its a game played through the browser where after you long off, the game world still exists and so does your character. It is often defined by 1000&#8217;s of players playing a game where they interact very much like a MMOG.

If you a player/developer support this project! This is our chance to make it known that we exist. To make our little corner of the net larger, better&#8230; and overall, provide a better playing experience to everyone.
