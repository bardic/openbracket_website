Well&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what this will mean yet, but the news was released about 12 hours ago that Sun Micosystems is going to buy MySQL for a grand total of 1billion dollars (I shit you naught) of cash and stock options.

You can find the announcement <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-01/sunflash.20080116.1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> on the offical Sun website.

With Java going open source about a year about and Sun having heavily contributed to OpenOffice and other open source projects, it makes me wonder what exactly their plans are with MySQL. Supposedly they intend to optimize the LAMP stack across all platforms. This could be great if it happens. As long as they don&#8217;t just sit on it or charge for licenses I think MySQL is in pretty good hands.

For those out of the loop, MySQL makes up the majority share of databases online, and is the main database used amongst PBBG developers because of its ease and that it&#8217;s free.
