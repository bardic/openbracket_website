If you have ever done flash development, you quickly realize that the Flash IDE is the worse play to actually write code. It&#8217;s down right awful. So you look at other IDEs; FlashDevelop, FlashBuilder, FDT, IntelliJ. If you are like me you would likely have settled on IntelliJ. The team at Jetbrains just get it. The tools is just brilliant from it&#8217;s svn/git integration to it colours to it&#8217;s epic refactor tools.

Well when I started doing more ObjectiveC development, I started to encounter issues with Xcode that bothered me greatly. Refactor was poor, version control integration was poor, the way it handled opening files frustrated me. Luckily, the Jetbrains team had developed an app that fixes all of these issues for me: <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppCode</a>.

Now AppCode isn&#8217;t perfect. It lacks the ability to handle xibs and xcdatamodels as well has some of the finer project settings (They actually may be there but if they are they are incredibly difficult to find and access). But despite these short comings this IDE is the bee&#8217;s knee&#8217;s. Fast, pretty, great refactor,  great app analysis and many more.  For me the price of having to open Xcode once or twice a day is completely worth the benefits that AppCode provides. Mind you, I  work on apps/games that don&#8217;t rely heavily on using xibs so I almost never have the need to open Xcode for that. But on the few projects I&#8217;ve done that heavily use xibs, I open Xcode, lay them out, hook up my outlets and then switch over to AppCode for everything else.

So if you develop ObjC and haven&#8217;t tried this I strongly suggest you download the trial and give it a goal. You&#8217;ll likely be hooked before the 30 days are up.

DISCLAIMER: I have no association with Jetbrains. I just love their software and think you should too
