Hey all. Just a little update to let everyone know I am still alive. I&#8217;ve been rather busy the last few weeks working for RasiedMedia and doing some freelance.  Hopefully I will be getting a new laptop soon (hopefully in about a month or two) which will increase productivity for me.

Anyways, I was thinking about &#8216;advanced&#8217; gaming features to develop in my free time in PHP/Actionscript. Anyone have some idea&#8217;s they are willing to share? I&#8217;m thinking I may try to tackle a crafting system and a quest building system. These both would be targeted to RPGs and likely will use a flash interface since I like flash and think I can make use of it for games. I know I could use AJAX but I don&#8217;t know javascript so Flash it is.

But back to the topic. If you have some suggestions for some features I can try to build them. If I do, I will make the code available.  I probably will do the same with the quest and crafting systems if I get them working the way I want.
