This is something I never understood why someone hasn&#8217;t done yet (to my knowledge). Part of gaming is showing off how l33t(3l33t,leet,elite 3|_337, etc) you are to your friends. So why don&#8217;t games have badges or little banners that players can put on their blogs, in their forum posts?

You first give players a way to show off to their friends their character/account details and second, you get free advertising. Make the images links back to the game and presto; You players get a nifty badge, and you get link backs.

You can also do similar things for alliances/faction/groups in the game. Opening just info even just a little would let the players build apps I&#8217;m sure to read this data and track their friends/enemies. I&#8217;ve played games (most notable, Earth 2025) where players take raw HTML and use it to keep track of alliance members.

May be interesting. Thoughts?

edit:
