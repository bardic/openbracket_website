Hey ya&#8217;ll! I know it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve posted, but I&#8217;m hoping to get back into the groove. With a recent move from Windows to Ubuntu, I lost a lot of my progress on my personal projects. I&#8217;ve also been very busy with work and spending as much time with my fiancee as I could.

But things are settling down and work is getting pretty interesting so I found out what I was allowed to talk about at work online and will hopefully be posting about that soon-ish (hope to get a real post out tonight).

My work keeps me primiarily in Flash/Flex and working closely with Electroserver so I will try to cover some of aspects of virtual world design and develop, multiplayer games and my new project, a Facebook game.

So check back later if any of that sounds interesting to ya and hopefully I&#8217;ll have a post or two!
