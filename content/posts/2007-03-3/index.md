I know I _could_ be writing about other things such as enusring the game in enjoyable for single users or a more technical issue such as cron jobs, but this has been bugging for me a bit. There are too many people out there that think IDEs are for suckers and that they are l33t because they script php in notepad or do all there html, xml, css, whatever also in notepad.

ThisÂ doesn&#8217;tÂ makeÂ youÂ betterÂ thanÂ thoseÂ thatÂ useÂ IDEs.Â ActuallyÂ it&#8217;sÂ theÂ opposite.Â ThoseÂ ofÂ usÂ thatÂ workÂ inÂ theÂ webÂ fieldÂ know
  
thatÂ using an IDE is not only easier, but FAR more efficent. I have colored text, I have intellisense, auto completion, an eviroment that I can test code easily, tabs, better layout options and a number of other things.

I can almsot gurantee that if I and someone else were to write a scripts, me using an IDE and them using notepad, that I have cleaner code, and be done much faster.

So,Â nowÂ thatÂ littleÂ rantÂ isÂ out,Â whatÂ IDEsÂ areÂ onesÂ thatÂ areÂ worthÂ buying/ stealing/ trying. But it really depends on what you want to code. If you want web languages (html,xml,css) Dreamweaver is by FAR the best. If you&#8217;re doing PHP/MySQL then you want Zend. ASP.NET is VisualBasic. For Java, get Netbeans. It&#8217;s great and free. Though I don&#8217;t like Java ğŸ˜›

PersonallyÂ IÂ useÂ ZendÂ andÂ Dreamweaver.Â IÂ actuallyÂ useÂ DreamweaverÂ dailyÂ now.Â IÂ alsoÂ workÂ inÂ flashÂ onÂ aÂ dailyÂ basisÂ now writing actionscript. But I&#8217;m attempting to find a better IDE. Flash works but its not that great. If anyone knows one tell me.

So anyways, let&#8217;s wrap this up. USE A DAMN IDE! It will make life easier and make you more effiecent, which is a good thing. On a side note, sorry I have posted much lately. Started a new job so when everything settle downs I&#8217;ll start writing again.
