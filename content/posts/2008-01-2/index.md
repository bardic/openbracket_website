With the last post being about graphics and the topic that for some audiences that more graphics are better, the thought of target audience has been with me. So I looked back on my designs (which I swear I will someday actually finish) and realized that I&#8217;ve been designing more for an &#8216;adult&#8217; audience. Not in the sense that there&#8217;s violence or swearing, but the way the games work. Most of my designs require making decisions based on detailed information about your character or country. They also are heavily laid with player interaction, and not just making friends, but manipulating and using other players&#8230; that is if you have the skill to do so.

How does this relate to the graphics? Thanks for the question. With a more mature audience  that isn&#8217;t expecting graphics while playing this kind of game, an abundance of graphics would likely irritate my target audience.

So, which should be done first? Figure out your target audience, or design then game, then target that audience? Sometimes it&#8217;s difficult to tell where one begins and the other ends. I want to design a certain kind of game, so by deciding that I just want to design that type of game, I&#8217;ve already picked out my audience. But there is nothing wrong with that.

The important thing I think is to realize early on in the design who your audience is going to be, so you can build the entire game out to meet the expectations of those you wish to play.  So if I want to target the 14-18 age group, I&#8217;m likely not going to make the game require a lot of micro-management.  I will likely instead make the game focus around groups and interaction of those groups, with a simple, but pretty GUI. But if I&#8217;m going to make a game for 20 somethings +, targeting old school RPers / MUDers, I&#8217;m going to give the players a lot of control over their character and interaction in the world and focus on text (story, descriptions of events and areas) and navigation. That group is far more likely to endure an hour or two of nothing more than exploring a small village and talking to all the villagers just to gain some more info on the story.

As you can see, graphics for the first group is far more important since they want to &#8220;see&#8221; what they are going, while for the second group, they want to &#8220;do&#8221;, and while showing them might be neat, letting them imagine for themselves is part of the fun.

You also gain more important details though than just the amount of graphics you intend to use from figuring out your target. You can determine what kind of language they expect the game to use, the style of play, the navigation, the amount of detail in story, events, characters, the amount of interaction with items and people and even how they expect the game to play out in terms of rounds, persistent, or event wise.

So while you don&#8217;t need to, I think, have a target audience when you initially start a game design, it&#8217;s a good idea you figure out who you are going to target early on in the development stages of the game.
