When you play a web game, what is that you look for? Personally, I look for a challenge,  things to do and interaction with other players. If I&#8217;m not just odd, and other people agree with this, why the hell do other pages lack so badly in these fields?

I worked solely on the design aspect of my current game in development, for about 2 or 3 months. Though my game is similar to others out there, it&#8217;s in the details where I hope to make my stand. I simply had to look and see where other games failed, such as TornCity. In TC player interaction is minimal, as is communication and development.  To be honest it lacks horribly in many fields that truly make a game addicting.

Lets look at StarKingdoms. Great player interaction, great communication, and is a challenge. It&#8217;s a good game. The only qualm I have is I am forced to play with others I don&#8217;t choose too. I would rather be able to choose you I interact with and when I do it.

These are just personal views but as you can see these are all things that must be taken into consideration before you start your code and even before you start your design. You have to decide how to want you players to interact and how you want them to develop.

Here one of the better ways to start your development. Think of you game, get the genre, the setting all that planned out. Then think of a goal. Then as many ways to achieve that goal as possible. In my case I have multiple goals. You can either aim to be the strongest, the best hacker, the biggest gang.. whatever you want.

Next, how do I want my players to interact? Do I want to force them or do I trust their abilities to want to branch out and interact or do I want to kick them in the path of interacting? I personally want to kick them. And hard. Then you encounter what is too hard? Well too hard is when you make the game unplayable unless they work with others all the time. There should be the element of being a single entity in the universe.

After you have all this planned out, your core to the game, you then fill in details and backgrounds. You flesh the game out.

And this simple path will also guide you in coding. You work on the core first, coding everything that makes the game playable, even if its just a little. This wil, and trust me from experience, keep you on a track that allows for a early alpha launch and makes your life easier.

Right now I am just breaking out of the details and moving back to the core development to try and launch an alpha. The details and hold you back. But that is another post that will come soon. I hope this helps you design more efficiently. I have designed a number of table top games and have several web game designs floating. Working that path I explained will not only make it easy but help you in working out the flaws in the core, which is far more important that details.
