As I cruise the web, playing different games that check my interest, there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m constantly on the look out for and that&#8217;s an rpg with a great story. And I&#8217;ve stumbled across a few that claim to have great stories, but those ones are usually single player with horrible interfaces.  Usually bad enough to make me forget it&#8217;s not the 90&#8217;s.

I don&#8217;t understand why there is a huge hole in there genre of PBBG&#8217;s. It could just be that I&#8217;m just looking in the wrong place, and if that&#8217;s case, please educate me. But I&#8217;m gonna talk a little about this and pretty much just organize my thoughts on this since this is something I would like to do at some point in time (You know, that &#8216;free time&#8217; that people have. I would love to get to know that part of the Time stream&#8230;).

When I look at all the times I&#8217;ve played and try to figure out what people avoid quests is mainly the amount of effort needed to build and maintain such a system.  I can&#8217;t argue with that. It would be a large amount of work to create a game that gives you mass player interaction and story game play, but isn&#8217;t it odd that one still doesn&#8217;t exist?  Maybe there is something else I am missing here.

Maybe it&#8217;s one of the issues that I have encountered in my head every time I try to think of such a system is how to handle groups of players working together simultaneously. Almost every way I think of takes some control from players, which is something I would like to avoid. Sure I would use javascript and just constantly refresh the page until the players appear, or I could use flash with a server so that I can tell the other players in the room that I&#8217;ve arrived, but both of those solutions seems sloppy to me. I would much rather have it as simple as possible with just html links. This is the biggest hurdle in my opinion, but I dunno.

So does anyone else have any idea&#8217;s as to way such games don&#8217;t exist, or if they do exist, links?
