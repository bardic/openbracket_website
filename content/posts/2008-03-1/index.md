Through the comment left by Ranger Sheck on the [previous post][1] here at OpenBracket, I found a link to an [extremely nice site][2] focused on the design of PBBGs. Ranger Sheck&#8217;s home page is a blog about designing PBBGs in just the same vein of discussion as this blog. Some of his most recent posts include a post on [interface design][3], [statistics][4], and a nice javascript library for [maps][5]. I strongly suggest checking the site out and following it. To prove the authenticity of Ranger Sheck&#8217;s discussions, he is working with a team to design a role-playing PBBG called [Pioneers of Aethora][6]. I have been playing it recently and find it a quite satisfying game though still in development. As a side note, the game is being written in Ruby through the [Rails][7] framework. This is compelling for me as I am just beginning to learn Ruby on Rails and hope to write about my learning experience as it applies to game development right here at OpenBracket!

PS: My name is Jake and I am the &#8216;new guy.&#8217; I will be posting a news article on a PHP PBBG engine soon as well as discussing database design. I look forward to a discussion with our readers here! And thanks for bringing me on board, bardicknowledge!
