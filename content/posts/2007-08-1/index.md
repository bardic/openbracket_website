I know this doesn&#8217;t exactly have to deal with web games, but I am wondering what everyones favorite pnp is. I am personally attempting to get my friends to start playing again and I would like to playÂ somethingÂ other than DND. We may be actually making our own if we can&#8217;t find one that suits us, which I would likely share and based at least one web game off ðŸ˜›Â Speaking of my web games, my current situation is 3 in design, 2 finished design, 1 in coding, the other on hold. What does your guys plates look like?Â
