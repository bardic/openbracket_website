Here&#8217;s my plan:

v0.1

  * Player creatation/login
  * Some sort of design &#8211; rough
  * A working home page &#8211; This break down into: 
      * Inventory
      * Player stats
      * Equipable items
  * A working map page 
      * Players can see other players on the map and move around
      * Can engage in combat
      * Map will update as players move
      * Actual art and proper layout
  * Admin tools for: 
      * Item/NPC/Creature/Quest creatation
      * Map editting tool &#8211; Torn on how to make this tool. If I use AIR it would be much faster for me to make and would, I think, run faster with all the elements beinging on the local machine.Â  Web based has the bonus of access from anywhere. I&#8217;m leadning towards AIR but I&#8217;ll put more thought into this after I get the map mostly working with nodejs

v0.2 &#8211; **Private alpha**

  * Forum
  * Parties
  * A 30% (at least) complete map with art
  * NPC with basic quest

v0.3

  * player levels/skills/stats/crafting options complete

v0.4

  * Complete implementation of the living universe quest system
  * Game libraries &#8211; Records of the games history

v0.5

  * First major story arch added.
  * Creature AI
  * Creature population

v0.6

  * Map art 75% complete
  * Market

v0.7

  * Populate world with towns/npcs

v0.8- **Beta**

  * Site&#8217;s final art/layout
  * Minor quests and major arch 2

v0.9

  * Balancing
  * Load testing / optimizations
  * Bug fixing

v 1.0 &#8211; **Launch**

  * Donatation page
  * Site Ads
  * Ad campagain
  * Dance party
