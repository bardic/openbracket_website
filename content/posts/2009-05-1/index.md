Ya ya&#8230; I&#8217;m a horrible blogger, developer, and procrastinator.  If I can think of any reason to put something off, I will. It&#8217;s a horrible trait I picked up a few years ago in an accident, but I&#8217;m hoping (again) to get back on track.  I&#8217;m gonna try to take some time every day to work on a post and hope to get about 2 or 3 out a week.

Now, ANY suggestions on posts or topics or anything would be fucking great! Every time I write something I feel like I&#8217;m just repeating an older post so if you have any idea&#8217;s please share em.

I&#8217;m also trying to develop more on my free time. I work a mad amount and most of my free time I spend with my gf, but I&#8217;m gonna try to also put more time into dev. I have a few friends that are willing to help which will hopefully keep me in line ^^

So, I hope to start development on two games within the next month. Just need to ramp up some lacking PHP skills since I&#8217;ve spent the last year in AS3.
