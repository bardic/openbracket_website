Moving from Actionscript to Unity one of the things I missed the most was a framework like <a href="http://www.robotlegs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robotlegs</a> that has been the base for any as3 project I&#8217;ve done in the last year or two. Recently a buddy at work discovered <a href="https://github.com/thirdmotion/strangeioc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StrangeIoC</a> and I must say, it is awesome. Â If you haven&#8217;t used and IoC framework before you should really check it out.

Anyways, if you are familiar with Robotlegs then this is definitely for you since the API is very similar. So similar in fact that a <a href="http://thirdmotion.github.io/strangeioc/rl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide for RL users exists</a>!

Give it a shot. It&#8217;s bloody awesome
