Since I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of ObjectiveC lately I&#8217;ve been stuck in XCode and coming from better IDEs (IntelliJ; and yes I know about AppCode but I don&#8217;t have a license) I&#8217;ve become very accustomed to a certain workflow that I&#8217;ve had difficulty reproducing.

But recently I took some time and found a few of the shortcuts that I \*need\* which decrease my reliance on my mouse

&nbsp;

  * Quick Open: cmd+shift+o
  * Jump to: cmd+ctrl+click
  * Jump to in new tab: cmd+alt+click
  * Switch tabs: cmd+shift+ { or }
  * Global Find: cmd+shift+f

&nbsp;

Still haven&#8217;t found a shortcut for quick refactoring so if you know of one please share.
