A year ago today, I wrote my first post here. I never thought I would actually make a year or have people read and comment.Â  So in honor of OpenBrackets one year, I would ask that if all readers could have a drink, and take a picture of themselves with OpenBracket opened on their screen.

It&#8217;s been a great year and I hope to continue this. I&#8217;d like to take all the readers and the regaulr commenters. You guys are the reason this blog keeps going. Thank you all.
