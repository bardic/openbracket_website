For the last few months, I have primarily been doing only Unity work and have come to rely on a few third party tools every day:

### RageSpline

<http://ragespline.com/>

  * Generate 2D vector graphics inside Unity Editor with bézier splines
  * Fully adjustable colors and gradients + emboss styling
  * Multi-texturing with easy texture positioning
  * Automatic physics collider generation with BoxCollider and MeshCollider options
  * Adjustable vertex count for visuals and physics.
  * Grid & snapping gizmo for accurate drawing
  * Good peformance on iOS/Android
  * RageSpline API for run-time code access

### 2dToolKit

2D Toolkit provides an efficient and flexible 2D sprite and text system which integrates seamlessly into the Unity environment. Our key focus with this product is mobile performance and workflow efficiency.

2D Toolkit is designed for rapid prototyping, and is built to take you all the way to a shipping game.

### NGUI

NGUI is a powerful UI system and event notification framework for Unity (both Pro and Free) written in C# that closely follows the [KISS principle][2]. It features clean code and simple, minimalistic approach to everything. Most classes are kept under 200 lines of code. For a programmer this means a much easier time when it comes to working with the kit — from extending its functionality to tweaking the existing one. For everyone else this means better performance, less frustration, and more fun.

### Bonus! Playmaker

This is possibly the most powerful tool I have used to date in Unity, but I haven&#8217;t been able to explore it as fully I would like to. In short, it&#8217;s a FSM that can easily hook into all aspects of your application. It allows the developer to quickly and visually create easy light switches to complex AI.
