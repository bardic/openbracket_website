    				There have been a few changes here and a few more are on the way.  Most notably is that here forward I will attempt to use excerpts to reduce the 'wall of text' that my blog was/is. Please let me know in the comments what you think of this change. If people like it I'll keep it, otherwise I'll revert. Another change that will be coming soon is a Lantern page where I will keep an updated overview of the game and it's features.
    Hope everyone likes these changes ^^
