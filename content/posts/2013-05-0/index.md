So since my memory sucks and I likely will forget this one, I&#8217;m going to put it here. It&#8217;s an easy enough fix and a stupid error on my part but it took me a good 30 minutes to figure it out.

On compile after creating an empty project I received this error

> Source/Main.hx:15: lines 15-35 : Missing super constructor call

The solution is to add super() to your new function for your class.
