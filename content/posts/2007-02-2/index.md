So, you have your design \*completed\* now and you are ready to crack up Zend or Dreamweaver or maybe even Notepad (I suggest Zend).

**STOP!**

Don&#8217;t go any further. Before you even think of scripting your game, go out and buy some cue cards or do it on your PC. It really doesn&#8217;t matter but plan out each and every page! I tell you this from personal experience: without this plan you will site around for while trying to remember how you had two pages connected, or what tables need to be updated on a event. And if you get really detailed (which I will be doing on my next game), which variables were used and what they contain.

So if you actually believe me, which I really hope you do, it will help, grab a piece of paper. First plan out ALL your tables. You\*will\* come back to these later to add new columns which you didn&#8217;t think of at the time. It always happens when working on a project of these size. **But thats fine, since this plan isn&#8217;t set in stone. This is meant to guide you and keep track of everything that needs to be done, what has been done and how things connect.** 

You now have your tables designed to some extent on paper hopefully. Next is designing the pages on paper (or virutally. your choice). The way I do it is first going through and just think of all the pages I need and writing them down without the details and connecting them. You may want to do the details as you go, but I find it easier to connectthe pages before adding the details. You will also want to draw arrows to and from the databased when needed. So a grab from the database to display character information, or an arrow to it to show a field Update. If you are following my path, you will now need to fill out the details of each page. Again, you will likely come back to edit this once you start coding, but you at least now have a visual of everything you need, how its connected and most of the details or each page.

You should now be looking at a page filled with mad scribbling and a bunch of arrows. You may want to tidy it up or put each page/table on a cue card and stick &#8217;em up on your wall. Anyway you look at it, you now have a **plan** instead of an **idea**.

You can also apply part of my idea&#8217;s to your development too. I mentioned before when planning to start with the basic name then filling out the details. Well the way I work is I go through and try to get the basic functionality of each page down and then will go back later and fill in the details (Proper text, messages), make tweaks, apply styles, graphics, etc. I do this for two main reasons. One is to make connections. I find if you make a pages completely then go to work on a page that is connected to it, you will eventually need to go back and start changing things on the so called completed page, and two, because if I stare at the same script for too long I start to get annoyed with it.

I hope this has helped you along with your development. And as usual, feedback is MORE than welcomed. Without your input, how can I/we create a blog with the best tips/guides/ideas for us developers/designers. Remember you aren&#8217;t alone and there are people similar to you that can help you with your game. All you need to do is ask ðŸ™‚
