What drives people to play online games? Why would I want to play an online browser game when I can play a game with graphics by myself, or even on online? There are two reasons I believe people play browser games: One is that they offer a (hopefully) in-depth/enjoyable game that can be played anywhere, and two, the community. So why do some people over look the building a proper forums/chat system and for those games that do realize this is important, are there any ways we can improve upon this?

Well before we start trying to improve it, lets examine the standards: Forums, Shout Boxes, and IRC. Pretty standard and most of these are seen in most games. I can honestly say I don&#8217;t know of a game that doesn&#8217;t have at least one of those. But I don&#8217;t know how a online browser game could function without one of them. Anywho, these are great ways of communication for players and a lot of games do a pretty good job of implementing them. Alas, with our field, there is always room for innovation or improvement.

So, lets start on IRC. IRC (Internet Chat Rely) has been around for a while and is an extremely easy way for groups of people to easily and quickly communicate. Unless you plan on writing your own client, there isn&#8217;t really a way to improve IRC. It&#8217;s when people don&#8217;t use IRC is when the problem arises. I will use an example: FurtureCriminal. Instead of using an IRC client, they use instead a HORRIBLE flash based chat. The problem is they can&#8217;t afford a IRC server. Understandable, but you can make one for free on one of the large, pre-exisiting networks. Why I support IRC so much is that it is the BEST way for a group of players to have live chat. Plus, your players can decide how they want to connect to the channel. Be it ChatZillia, mIRC or Xchat, they can use a client they enjoy.

Next, let&#8217;s do an over view of forums, shout boxes, or whatever else that uses a database. These things should all exist \*IN\* game. I should not need to long into the game and the forums separately. I shouldn&#8217;t need to leave the game to communicate with other players. A game that does forums pretty good in TornCity.  My forums and character account are connected. So when I browse the forums I can easily click on a persons name and bring up their profile.  You can do the same with your shout boxes, etc. This leads to a possibility that I am openly exploring for several of my designs: Forum activity can lead to character bonuses, experience etc. Why would you want to do this? Well the main reason is an activity community makes the game FAR more enjoyable in my opinion. So, with a forums that is tied into your character account it would be easy for developers to create features that integrate the players activity in the forums.

This, of course, leads to the problem of spamming, flaming, etc. I have been thinking about how to get around it and the easiest way I think would be a two pronged solution: The first would be a group of moderators and flags. By flags I mean other users could reports spam/flames by flagging another person. But all this is pointless if there is no deterrent hen your giving out experience or points for activity. So with flagging, it sends a report to the mods. The mods can review it. If the person flagged was spamming/flaming they loss points, while the person that flagged them gains some. And if a flag is wrong, the person will be docked points. This will eventually lead to a self moderated forum here for 90% of the time (I believe) people would behave themselves. You could of course have your spam sub forum where so points are gained for posting but it lets player let steam off.

I&#8217;m sure some people will disagree with me about the points for activity. That&#8217;s just a design I am playing with because I personally think it&#8217;s a good idea. But even if you disagree with the points, having the forums in game using your character account is a point I&#8217;m not willing to concede. Yes, it takes more effort to do, and when you initially launch a game you may use an external forums but you should set it up so that when you integrate the forums in game that it is smooth and not just a hack job. But I bet you your community would far rather an ingame board instead of an external one. As I said it makes it easier to track players and makes life easier and quicker for those that want to use your forums.

As always I am open for debate. Or other ideas. I sure as hell can&#8217;t think of every possible way this can be done. But for me, this way makes the most sense from a design usability point of view.
