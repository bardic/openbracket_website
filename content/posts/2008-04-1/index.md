With the release of AIR for Linux, Adobe has given us a very interesting piece of software for us to play with and attempt to work into our games. Myself, working mainly as a Actionscript developer, find this app to offer a wealth of potential to us.

For those that don&#8217;t know what <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AIR </a>is, it simply put is a desktop widget system. But it much more than that. It offers the user the chance to interact with your web content from their desktop. Just imagine a player getting a notification in the corner of their screen that they have been attacked in game, or that their research has completed or they have new mail. Imagine that they could easily respond or perform a new action using the same interface such as reply to the map, check their status, or attack back.

This could be a big step for game design.

But I&#8217;m more curious as to what everyone elses thoughts on this is. This AIR widget of course wouldn&#8217;t be the core of your game. But just a way to always let your players interact with the game.
