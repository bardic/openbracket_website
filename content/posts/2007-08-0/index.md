I have just finished the design of a game of the first game I am going to produce. I have design several others but this is the first one I feel is ready for the web. Currently I am the only code developer in the group of people that I design with. So in an attempt to get a hand I post this <a href="http://halifax.kijiji.ca/c-jobs-programmers-computer-Intermediate-PHP-developers-wanted-W0QQAdIdZ19833262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ad</a> on Kijiji.

Hopefully this will work and that I find another developer or two within my city that would help create the code with me. My second game, which I hope to finish design within the month, will likely be launched into beta within a month after the first ones beta launch.

I will post back with how well this ad works. If it does some other may want to try doing something similar to this.

Gonna try to write a quick post tonight about sandbox style games and what I think of  them if I&#8217;m able to remain awake.
