We are in a field where the ability to navigate quickly and easily are everything. Where players have little time to waste drilling down through 15 sub menus to get to the games more in-depth features or functions. So I pose this question for all the readers: If navigation and layout is so important for browsergames, why do so many sites have horrible layout or nav?

The simple answer is the developers don&#8217;t think it is a problem. It&#8217;s not that they can&#8217;t make better navs, it&#8217;s just many don&#8217;t believe it is important as functionality or &#8216;game play&#8217;. How the hell can someone say a browser based games gameplay isn&#8217;t effected by page layout and navigation? The game is purely navigation! I understand not everyone who creates web games to be designers, but this doesn&#8217;t require a lot of design skills.

&#8220;How can we fix our nav/page layouts Bardic?&#8221; you may be asking right now. Well I will share my thoughts on it since you asked so nicely: Keep it simple. Really. There is absolutely no need to have extreme animations, or hundreds of graphic buttons. Simple text links that are positioned nicely on your page with an obvious trait that defines them as links works great. But this is only half of the problem.

Have to played a game where you want to say, sell an item. And you need to make 5 or 6 clicks to get to the necessary page? I hate that. I personally try to make all my web sites, not just games, need no more than four clicks to find the information that you want. Keeping the number of clicks needed to get information isn&#8217;t just a good site design idea, but is a good game design idea. You want your players to be able to quickly perform actions, gather information and interact with each other. Especially interact with each other.

If it takes too much effort to communicate with each other players just won&#8217;t do it.

So, what do we have? Simple, clean, and as little clicks as possible. Not that hard sounding, eh? But here arises another problem: Information overload. When people think of making theirnav as few clicks as possible, they have the tendency to make a &#8216;city&#8217; page with about 20 links on it, which are ambiguous and poorly categorized. A good way to organize a lot of links are rollover menus. Some may think they are cheesy but they do organize the links and allows player to quickly skip 2 or 3 sub menus.

For those that are ambitious I have been playing with the idea of a flash or javascript navigation system, where clicking on a &#8216;map&#8217; button brings up anav tree that would allows the player to view all the site links at once and with one click take them where ever they want. I haven&#8217;t really seen this type ofnav implemented anywheres, but the idea tickles my fancy. I would lean to flash for two reasons: 1) I know flash far far better than javascript ðŸ˜› and 2) (the real reason) is that a lot of people turn of javascript. The only problem with the flash would be having it appear above the normal html/css site. But if I every find a way to do it properly I will share ^_^

But there you have it. Nav and layout are important and shouldn&#8217;t be overlooked. Please argue with me in the comments. Or agree. But with others input maybe we can discover a different view or approach. I don&#8217;t claim to be a god of PBBG design. Just a guy that has game design and web design experience. So please! Comment!

Next week I&#8217;ll have an article on communication in game, which I think is one of the most important features of any game&#8230;
