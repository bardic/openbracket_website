Have you ever signed up for a web game and played for about 15 minutes, stopped and asked yourself what the hell is the point? I have. Too many times. And this is because the game lacks a way for the player to feel like they are are growing or making any form of impact on the world.Â  I know I have discussed this <a href="http://webgamedev.wordpress.com/2007/08/07/openbracket-podcast-character-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before</a>, but I am going to try and go deeper than I did then.

I&#8217;m going to break this post up into two categories: Round based strategy games and persistent RPGs. This is because I feel that these different styles need to be approached with the fact in mind that we required customized needs. Not every game is going to have the same goals, since that obliviously isn&#8217;t something that will help you stand out but hopefully this will help the creative process.

**Â Round-based strategy games** (RBSG <- I&#8217;m coining that acronym ðŸ˜› )

So just to be clear, a RBSG is a game that lasts a month or two (sometimes longer) where players usually battle for high ranks.Â  And it works. Many good games of be based of that, but I feel there is always room for improvements. One of the first things, is persistent accounts. Many of the RBSGs I&#8217;ve played require the player to sign up each round with a new account. This eliminates the possibly of players having a personal record to show off their accomplishments.Â  So when a round ends, their latest stats are record to their profile and during the next round people can view where to placed the round before.

And why just record their networth rank.Â  Make it so that their total kills are shown, or their efficiency at research or maybe their attack/defense ratio. Giving players multiple ways to compare themselves to their friends/enemies will just provoke more competition; that is, if your game is design to allow for more than one style of play.

**Persistent role playing games:**

A RPG that doesn&#8217;t have any resets. You character never resets.

Games like this get very, very tricky when you start trying to plan out different ways for players to reach achievements. This is part of the reason you want to design a semi player driven goal system. But I&#8217;ll touch on that in a little bit.

So with a RPG where your character does not reset, the easiest way to compare your character to others is by level or rank, or total stats, or best equipment. And these are tried and true methods of competition, but it brings nothing new to the table.Â  A lot of this for a PRPG will depend on your design since these can vary a bit more than a RBSG.

You also need to take into consideration that new players will be joining a long time existing world, and they still need to have goals.Â  And this is where a player driven goal system comes into play. A well designed game will allow for players to play the game differently from others, which means that won&#8217;t all be trying to achieve the same thing. For instance, in a RPG, I may be trying to get the Sword of a red headed amazons Shin while one of my friends is attempting to collect all the dung beetles in town so they can make a hight level potion to attain a new skill.

As you can see using just number of skills or best armor wouldn&#8217;t do justice in a situation like this. Which is why I feel that each player should have a dynamic profile to display their goals/achievements. So if I were a warrior, I would go into my profile and want to show of my equipment, stats, and my current quest. So I would have a series of check boxes that I could click to display that. While my mage would want to display their best spells, their rank in the wizards guild,Â  which spell they are currently studying and what quest they are performing.

As you see, developing your game with all this in mind and that you want your players to possibly play the game in a new,Â  you can promote competition beyond just seeing you can be the biggest, strongest and spend the most time online playing the game.Â  I think is a step that PBBGs have been needing to take for sometime now and hopefully they will soon enough. I personally will be developing my games with these thoughts in mind.
