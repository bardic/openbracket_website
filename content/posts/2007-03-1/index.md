You are creating a <a href="http://www.pbbg.com/toast/toast.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PBBG</a> (persistent browser based game). You have your game core designed and it may be a great idea&#8230; one of the best of all time! But, you&#8217;re player&#8217;s interaction with each other sucks. You&#8217;re game fails. Simple. Player interaction in PBBG&#8217;s is one of the most important things to be considered and is often overlooked or it feels like it was an after thought.

&#8220;But I have factions/gang/group/clans&#8221; or whatever you want to call it. Sorry, but that isn&#8217;t enough player interaction. True players can interact with each other, but thats on a very limited scale. Usually at max 20 people, and even then you don&#8217;t normally need to interact with your &#8216;gangs&#8217;.  I personally think more emphasis should be on uniqueness among characters somehow, be it skills, units, territories&#8230;  And make it so that for a gang to operate smoothly they need all or close to all of the difference traits.

So, we now have determined that most games don&#8217;t have enough player interaction despite gangs, forums and chat.  We have also covered making players unique in some way and make each unique future useful.  What else could you possibly add? How about a market? Or mini games that involve more than one player? Make the players input on topics matter, like voting for something within a &#8216;gang&#8217;. Or make it so that wars are often and require everyone to communicate.

But lets go back for a second to forums and chat. These are also important things that shouldn&#8217;t be over looked. You should make it very obvious and extremely easy for players to post on the public and private forums.  I personally love TornCity&#8217;s idea. When you log in the first page is the 4 newest threads from the announcement section. I would  personally expand this to cover all sections instead of just the one. Also, the forums are ingame, which means members only need to log in once, aren&#8217;t taken out of game and are simple to use.  You can also apply this to your private &#8216;gang&#8217; forums, by having your gang home page display the newest 3 or 4 threads. Also, a shout box for the public or for gangs are great. It&#8217;s a quick and easy way for people to yell back and forth at each other.

As to a chat setup, please, please go with IRC. Using IRC gives your players the option of how they wish to connect to the chat. For example FutureCriminal uses a flash based chat which means you HAVE to use the crappy flash based chat service.

I will state again: Player interaction is the most important thing to these games. You could have the best single player ever but if I can&#8217;t play/chat/interact with others I frankly don&#8217;t care.

So keep this all in mind next time you are designing your games. This WILL help if you design this with the core of the system.

And as always, comments are welcomed!
