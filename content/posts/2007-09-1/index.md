it&#8217;s still on delay but it&#8217;s coming. i recently started myself on a new schedule to get more programming done but it leaves less time to write, but as soon as I finish it I will put it up.

Anyways in the mean time, I want to hear your views on database design and how much effort you put into it. I am currently in the phase where I am mapping out my databases. The way I do it is that I create the db then start writing skeleton scripts that mimic the way the game engine is going to work. Then after all it is sorted out I will just fleshing out the skeleton scripts with actual info from where it&#8217;s supposed to coming from.

But I think I spend a good amount of time trying to create my databases in an efficient way, aiming for at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3NF</a>(third normal form) . How much emphasis do you put on your db design?
